//One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. 
//The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in your HTML, you would write:
//let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
const button1  = document.querySelector("#button1"); //is a variable that is not going to be reassigned.
const button2  = document.querySelector("#button2");
const button3  = document.querySelector("#button3");
